#Data Analysis Project Repository
Welcome to my Data Analysis Project Repository! This repository contains multiple projects where I have applied data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data modeling techniques using SQL and Python.

Introduction
This repository showcases my skills in data analysis, covering various aspects such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data modeling. Each project is designed to demonstrate my proficiency in using SQL and Python for data manipulation and analysis.

Projects Overview

Project 1: Data Cleaning using SQL
In this project, I have performed data cleaning tasks on a raw dataset using MySQL Workbench. The objective was to clean and prepare the data for further analysis by addressing issues such as missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent data formats.

Files: Data cleaning.sql: Contains the SQL queries used for data cleaning.

Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL
This project involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL to uncover insights and patterns within the dataset. The analysis includes summarizing data, identifying trends, and visualizing relationships between variables.

Files: EDA.sql: Contains the SQL queries used for EDA.

Project 3: Data Exploration and Modeling on Salary Dataset using Python
In this project, I have used Python and its libraries to perform data exploration and modeling on a salary dataset. The analysis aims to gain insights into the factors affecting salaries and answer specific questions related to the dataset.
